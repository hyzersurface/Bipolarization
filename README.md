Zhang Xiaoming J.，Hu Yuzhong and Zhang Yiming

Polarization in the U.S. Congress has been a subject that has attracted many studies in recent years. We have developed an opinion dynamics model with affective homophily effect and national social norm effect to describe this phenomenon. The time evolution of polarization between the two parties are affected by three factors: the repulsive effect between the two parties, the attractive and repulsive effects between the members in each party, and the national social norm effect that pulls the members’ opinions towards a common national opinion norm. The model simulates the polarization and the spread of each party’s opinion distribution, and the results align well with 154 years of recorded data. The time evolution of the strength of the national social norm is obtained which is interpretable with the important historical events occurred during the past one and half century.
